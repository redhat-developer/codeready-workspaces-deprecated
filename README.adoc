# CodeReady Workspaces Lang Server Dependencies Builder

This repo used to contain builds for collecting or building 3rd party dependencies needed by stack/devfile/lang server sidecar images.

The contents of this repo have moved, and this repo will be deleted one day.

### Where did ___ go?

This repository no longer contains:

### Lang servers & dependencies (up to CRW 2.13)

* node10 and python - https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images/tree/crw-2-rhel-8/codeready-workspaces-plugin-java8/build

* golang - https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images/tree/crw-2-rhel-8/codeready-workspaces-stacks-golang/build

* php - https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images/tree/crw-2-rhel-8/codeready-workspaces-stacks-php/build

### Binaries (up to CRW 2.10)

* sleep - no longer used, as scratch images like machine-exec don't need a sleep binary to be pulled with the image-puller any more - https://github.com/che-incubator/kubernetes-image-puller/commit/ff890ed11234bc639ae05cd8c497708a579f5f5a
